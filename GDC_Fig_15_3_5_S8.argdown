GRE.1

+ COA.1 Late 1834: MUR and Lyell immediately as response to DLB; 
         denying @[CM Plants in Ancient Strata]

+ Lyellian Principals

+ French and Irish Evidence 

+ COA.2a At the Bristol meeting: Devon Campaign: Official summary

        LSIL fossil dating of non-Culm strata
        Culm trough


+ COA.3 ( bzw. COA.3' + COA.3'') 1836: Devon Campaign: MUR as response of conformable passage between Culm and the older strata
    and  Culm trough in central Devon

+ COA.2b At Bristol: Phillips identified Mountain Limestone fossils from the older part of the Culm

+  DEV.1 At Bristol meeting: Buckland

rausgefallen an dieser Stelle :  GRE.1b   At Bristol: DLB conceded his critics' structural interpretation and reversed the sequence

+ GRE.2    After the Bristol meeting: DLB accepted MUR's LSIL dating for the youngest non-Culm strata;
           this constituted a shift of the Culm to USIL

+ COA.4 MUR as response to Harding's report of fossil plants in the putative SIL strata 


+ DEV.2a Austen: Fossil from the younger non-Culm strata in south Devon were ML species
        Displaying them in public, late in 1837: South Devonian fossils dated to somewhere near the base of the ML


+ GRE.3a   DLB adopted Austen's ORS(ML) dating of the south Devonian fossils
           claimed to find evidence structural evidence that the Culm strata were older than south Devonien strata; Culm in the middle of the sequence

+ DEV.2b SED: Determined to retain older strata for his Cambrian;
              Unease about the elusive unconformity


+ DEV 3 MUR: Unease about plants in older north Devonian strata and elusive unconformity
            Enlarging ORS into a system; its equivalents might contain an intermediate fossil fauna effacing the elsuive sharp distinction between SIL and ML
            Devonian fauna intermediate between SIL and ML and Devon; 
            Devon as a major system, contemporary and representative of ORS; ORS local variety
            Evidence found 1839 in the Rhineland and 1840 in Russia

+ GRE.3b   Williams' partial concession to DEV

+ French Similarities
