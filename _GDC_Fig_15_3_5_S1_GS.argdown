[Standard Sequence]:  Given the strata are undisturbed, Cambrian strata are overlain by Silurian strata, Old Red Sandstone strata, Mountain Limestone strata, Coal Measures strata and New Red Sandstone strata, respectively #pri

[Formation of strata]: Strata are originally formed from sediments that were deposited in flat horizontal sheets - the younger sediments 
deposited on older ones. #pri

// [Definition Trough]: Iff strata are folded into an archlike form, with the concave side upward, then they form a trough #GRE #pri
