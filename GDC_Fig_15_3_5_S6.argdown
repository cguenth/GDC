GRE.1

+ COA.1 Late 1834: MUR and Lyell immediately as response to DLB; 
         denying @[CM Plants in Ancient Strata]

+ Lyellian Principals

+ French and Irish Evidence 

+ COA.2a At the Bristol meeting: Devon Campaign: Official summary

        LSIL fossil dating of non-Culm strata
        Culm trough


+ COA.3 ( bzw. COA.3' + COA.3'') 1836: Devon Campaign: MUR as response of conformable passage between Culm and the older strata
    and  Culm trough in central Devon

+ COA.2b At Bristol: Phillips identified Mountain Limestone fossils from the older part of the Culm

+  DEV.1 At Bristol meeting: Buckland

rausgefallen an dieser Stelle :  GRE.1b   At Bristol: DLB conceded his critics' structural interpretation and reversed the sequence

+ GRE.2    After the Bristol meeting: DLB accepted MUR's LSIL dating for the youngest non-Culm strata;
           this constituted a shift of the Culm to USIL

+ COA.4 MUR as response to Harding's report of fossil plants in the putative SIL strata 


+ DEV.2a Austen: Fossil from the younger non-Culm strata in south Devon were ML species
        Displaying them in public, late in 1837: South Devonian fossils dated to somewhere near the base of the ML
