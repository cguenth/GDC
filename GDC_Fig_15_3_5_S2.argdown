# Rival Hypotheses

[Devonian Strata as CAM]: In Devon, *all* the strata - older than the New Red Sandstone - are Cambrian in age #GRE #H1
 
[Culm as CM]: The Devonian Culm strata are Coal Measures in age #COA #H2

/* The explanations were understood to be rivals: */

[Culm as CM]
    -> [Devonian Strata as CAM] // H1 and H2 are contrary
    - [Devonian Strata as CAM]


# Evidence

/* The following items of evidence were considered to be relevant for deciding which of the three hypotheses is correct. */

[Unbroken Sequence of Devon Strata]: In Devon, *all* the strata - older than the New Red Sandstone - form an unbroken sequence of strata #ev #E1
 
[CM Plants in Devon Culm]: In Devon, the Culm strata contain Coal Measures fossil plants #ev #E2

[Trough through Exmoor]: There is a trough through Exmoor - formed by a band of limestone running out to the north coast at Ilfracombe and south of Barnstaple #ev #E3

[Instances of Coal in Ancient Strata]: In Munster and Pennsylvannia, there are coal deposits in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata #ev #E4

[Unconformity in Devon]: In Devon, there is a major unconformity between the Culm and the juxtaposed strata #ev #E5
    -> [Unbroken Sequence of Devon Strata] // E1 and E6 are contrary
    - [Unbroken Sequence of Devon Strata]
 
[CM Plants in Ancient French Strata]: In the Bocage, the limestones are pre-Old Red Sandstone in age and contain some Coal Measures fossil plants #ev #E6

[Munster Coal as Carboniferous]: In Munster, the limestone and coal seams are pre-Carboniferous in age #ev #E7
     -> [Instances of Coal in Ancient Strata] // E9 and E5 are subcontrary ? "Some coal is deposited in pre-ORS strata" vs "Some coal is not deposited in pre-ORS strata"

# Arguments and Further Theses {isGroup: false}

/* The arguments reconstructed in this section detail whether the two hypotheses can explain or whether they conflict with the available evidence.
Arguments are tagged according to whether the lay out explanatory relations or conflicts of hypothesis GRE and COA. 
In addition to these arguments, the section makes further auxiliary assumptions explicit. */


/* 

GRE.1a  DLB's proposal, late in 1834 

COA.1 Late 1834: MUR and Lyell immediately as response to DLB; 
         denying @[CM Plants in Ancient Strata]

// [Existence of a Global Sequence]: There is a sequence of distinctive major groups of strata which can be recognized throughout the world  #COA #pri


[Standard Sequence]: Cambrian strata are overlain by Silurian strata, Old Red Sandstone strata, Mountain Limestone strata, Coal Measures strata and New Red Sandstone strata, respectively #COA #pri


[Fossil Criterion]: Strata can be identified by means of their imbedded fossils #COA #pri

<Fossil Criterion and Common Species>: If two formations deposited at widely separated periods have more than only a few species in common, then strata cannot be identified by means of their imbedded fossils #COA

## Dating of the Non-Culm Strata {color: 6}


[Non-Culm Strata as CAM]: In Devon, the non-Culm strata are Cambrian in age #COA #chron-hyp

[CM Plants in Ancient Strata]: In pre-Old Red Sandstone strata, there are fossil plants similar to those of the Coal Measures  #GRE #pri


<Culm and CM Plants>: If the Devon Culm strata are pre-Old Red Sandstone in age and there are no Coal Measures plants in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata, then there are no Coal Measures plants in the Devon Culm strata  #GRE

[Lyellian Principals]: At the earth's surface, there is a constant but piecemeal change in the composition of the faunas and floras (in correlation with ever-changing physical environments) #COA #pri

[Common Species]: Two formations deposited at widely separated periods have few if any species in common #COA #pri
        >< [CM Plants in Ancient Strata]
    

<Assemblages of Species>: From Lyellian principals, it follows that while particular species might have long ranges in time, an assemblage of many species does not remain unchanged for long; therefore, two formations deposited at widely separated periods have few if any species in common #COA

## Youngest Devonian Strata {color: 3}

[Formation of strata]: Strata are originally formed from sediments that were deposited in flat horizontal sheets - the younger sediments deposited on older ones. #GRE #pri

[Definition Trough]: Iff the strata are folded into an archlike form, with the concave side upward, then they form a trough #GRE #pri

[Exmoor Youngest Devonian strata]: In Devon, among all the strata older than the New Red Sandstone, the strata of Exmoor are the youngest #GRE #chron-hyp

<Trough through Exmoor - GRE.1a>: If originally younger strata rest upon older ones and the strata of Exmoor are sandwiched between older strata, then the strata of Exmoor are located in a trough  #GRE
