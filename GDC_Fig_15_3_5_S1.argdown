# Rival Hypotheses

[Devonian Strata as CAM]: In Devon, *all* the strata - older than the New Red Sandstone - are Cambrian in age #GRE #chron-hyp


# Evidence

/* The following items of evidence were considered to be relevant for deciding which of the three hypotheses is correct. */

[Unbroken Sequence of Devon Strata]: In Devon, *all* the strata - older than the New Red Sandstone - form an unbroken sequence of strata #ev #E1
 
[CM Plants in Devon Culm]: In Devon, the Culm strata contain Coal Measures fossil plants #ev #E2

[North of Exmoor]: Passing Exmoor northwards, the strata become older #ev #E3

[Trough through Exmoor]: There is a trough through Exmoor - formed by a band of limestone running out to the north coast at Ilfracombe 
and south of Barnstaple #ev #E4
 
[Instances of Coal in Ancient Strata]: In Munster and Pennsylvannia, there are coal deposits in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata #ev #E5




# Arguments and Further Theses {isGroup: false}

/* The arguments reconstructed in this section detail whether the two hypotheses can explain or whether they conflict with the available evidence.
Arguments are tagged according to whether the lay out explanatory relations or conflicts of hypothesis GRE and COA. 
In addition to these arguments, the section makes further auxiliary assumptions explicit. */

// [Existence of a Global Sequence]: There is a sequence of distinctive major groups of strata which can be recognized throughout the world  #COA #pri


[Standard Sequence]: Given the strata are undisturbed, Cambrian strata are overlain by Silurian strata, Old Red Sandstone strata, Mountain Limestone strata, 
Coal Measures strata and New Red Sandstone strata, respectively #COA #pri




## Gap in the Sequence {color: 4}

[Gap in a Sequence of Strata]: There is a gap in a local sequence of strata, iff there are strata juxtaposed belonging to different 
but not successive geological periods #GRE #pri

<Unbroken Sequence - GRE.1a>: If, in Devon, all the strata are Cambrian in age, i.e. belonging to the same geological period, then there is no gap in the 
local sequence. #GRE

## Dating of the Culm {color: 5}

[Culm as CAM]: The whole Culm strata of Devonshire are Cambrian in age #GRE #chron-hyp
    + [Devonian Strata as CAM]


## Aporia I : Coal in Ancient Strata {color: 1}

[Coal in Ancient Strata]: There are coal deposits in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata #GRE #pri

[Instances of Ancient Strata]: In Munster and Pennsylvannia, there are pre-Old Red Sandstone strata #GRE #chron-hyp

of Munster and Pennsylvannia #GRE

        -> [Instances of Coal in Ancient Strata]



## Aporia II : CM Plants in Ancient Strata {color: 2}

[CM Plants in Ancient Strata]: In pre-Old Red Sandstone strata, there are fossil plants similar to those of the Coal Measures  #GRE #pri


<Culm and CM Plants>: If the Devon Culm strata are pre-Old Red Sandstone in age and there are no Coal Measures plants in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata, 
then there are no Coal Measures plants in the Devon Culm strata  #GRE

    (1) [Culm as CAM]
    (2) There are no CM plants in CAM strata

    (3) There are no CM Plants in Devon Culm strata
         -> [CM Plants in Devon Culm]


[Flora Similarities as Best Explanation]: The best explanation of the existence of coal in some strata G is the similarity between G's flora 
and the one of the Coal Measures (the Coal Measures being noted for the great amounts of coal they contain) #GRE #aux


<Coal and CM Plants>: If the similarity between the floras of the Coal Measures and pre-Old Red Sandstone formations is the best explanation 
for the existence of coal deposists in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata, then there are Coal Measures plants in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata. #GRE

## Youngest Devonian Strata {color: 3}

[Formation of strata]: Strata are originally formed from sediments that were deposited in flat horizontal sheets - the younger sediments 
deposited on older ones. #GRE #pri

// [Definition Trough]: Iff strata are folded into an archlike form, with the concave side upward, then they form a trough #GRE #pri

[Traversing Northward]: The strata south of Exmoor become progessively younger the furhter one traverses northward #GRE #chron-hyp

[Exmoor Trough as Best Explanation]: Assuming that the strata south of Exmoor become progessively younger the furhter one traverses northward 
and that, originally, younger strata rest upon older ones, 
the existence of a trough running trough Exmoor is the best explanation of the strata north of Exmoor being older  #GRE #aux


<Trough through Exmoor - GRE.1a>: If the existence of a trough running trough Exmoor is the best explanation of 
the Exmoor strata being juxtaposed solely by older strata, then there is a trough through Exmoor  #GRE

[Exmoor Youngest Devonian strata]: In Devon, among all the strata older than the New Red Sandstone, the strata of Exmoor are the youngest #GRE #chron-hyp

<Exmoor and Devonian Strata>: Assuming that, originally, younger strata rest upon older ones, it holds: 
If the Exmoor strata is not the youngest, then there is no trough through Exmoor  #GRE
