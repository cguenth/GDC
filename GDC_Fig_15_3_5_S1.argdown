# Rival Hypotheses

[Devonian Strata as CAM]: In Devon, *all* the strata - older than the New Red Sandstone - are Cambrian in age #GRE #H1


# Evidence

/* The following items of evidence were considered to be relevant for deciding which of the three hypotheses is correct. */

[Unbroken Sequence of Devon Strata]: In Devon, *all* the strata - older than the New Red Sandstone - form an unbroken sequence of strata #ev #E1
 
[CM Plants in Devon Culm]: In Devon, the Culm strata contain Coal Measures fossil plants #ev #E2

[Trough through Exmoor]: There is a trough through Exmoor - formed by a band of limestone running out to the north coast at Ilfracombe and south of Barnstaple #ev #E3

[Instances of Coal in Ancient Strata]: In Munster and Pennsylvannia, there are coal deposits in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata #ev #E4



# Arguments and Further Theses {isGroup: false}

/* The arguments reconstructed in this section detail whether the two hypotheses can explain or whether they conflict with the available evidence.
Arguments are tagged according to whether the lay out explanatory relations or conflicts of hypothesis GRE and COA. 
In addition to these arguments, the section makes further auxiliary assumptions explicit. */


/* 

GRE.1a  DLB's proposal, late in 1834

// [Existence of a Global Sequence]: There is a sequence of distinctive major groups of strata which can be recognized throughout the world  #COA #pri


[Standard Sequence]: Cambrian strata are overlain by Silurian strata, Old Red Sandstone strata, Mountain Limestone strata, Coal Measures strata and New Red Sandstone strata, respectively #COA #pri




## Gap in the Sequence {color: 4}

[Gap in a Sequence of Strata]: There is a gap in a local sequence of strata, iff there are strata juxtaposed belonging to different but not successive geological periods #GRE #pri

<Unbroken Sequence - GRE.1a>: If, in Devon, all the strata are Cambrian in age, i.e. belonging to the same geological period, then there is no gap in the local sequence. #GRE

## Dating of the Culm {color: 5}

[Culm as CAM]: The whole Culm strata of Devonshire is Cambrian in age #GRE #chron-hyp

<Culm as CAM>: If, in Devon, all the strata are Cambrian in age, then the Culm strata are Cambrian in age, too #GRE

    (1) [Devonian Strata as CAM]
    ----
    (2) [Culm as CAM] 


## Dating of the Non-Culm Strata {color: 6}


[Non-Culm Strata as CAM]: In Devon, the non-Culm strata are Cambrian in age #COA #chron-hyp
    + [Devonian Strata as CAM] // If the whole of the Devonian strata are CAM, then the non-Culm strata are CAM



## Aporia I : Coal in Ancient Strata {color: 1}

[Coal in Ancient Strata]: There are coal deposits in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata #GRE #pri

[Instances of Ancient Strata]: In Munster and Pennsylvannia, there are pre-Old Red Sandstone strata #GRE #chron-hyp

<Coal in Ancient Strata>: If there are no coal deposits in Pre-Old Red Sandstone strata, then there are no coal deposits in the pre-Old Red Sandstone strata of Munster and Pennsylvannia #GRE

## Aporia II : CM Plants in Ancient Strata {color: 2}

[CM Plants in Ancient Strata]: In pre-Old Red Sandstone strata, there are fossil plants similar to those of the Coal Measures  #GRE #pri


<Culm and CM Plants>: If the Devon Culm strata are pre-Old Red Sandstone in age and there are no Coal Measures plants in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata, then there are no Coal Measures plants in the Devon Culm strata  #GRE

    (1) [Culm as CAM]
    (2) There are no CM plants in CAM strata

[Flora Similarities as Best Explanation]: The best explanation of the existence of coal in some strata G is the similarity between G's flora and the one of the Coal Measures (the Coal Measures being noted for the great amounts of coal they contain) #GRE


<Coal and CM Plants>: If the similarity between the floras of the Coal Measures and pre-Old Red Sandstone formations is the best explanation for the existence of coal deposists in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata, then there are Coal Measures plants in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata. #GRE

## Youngest Devonian Strata {color: 3}

[Formation of strata]: Strata are originally formed from sediments that were deposited in flat horizontal sheets - the younger sediments deposited on older ones. #GRE #pri

[Definition Trough]: Iff the strata are folded into an archlike form, with the concave side upward, then they form a trough #GRE #pri

[Exmoor Youngest Devonian strata]: In Devon, among all the strata older than the New Red Sandstone, the strata of Exmoor are the youngest #GRE #chron-hyp

<Trough through Exmoor - GRE.1a>: If originally younger strata rest upon older ones and the strata of Exmoor are sandwiched between older strata, then the strata of Exmoor are located in a trough  #GRE
