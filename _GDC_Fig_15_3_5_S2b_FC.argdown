""ages" of particular races of oragnic beings (especially terrestrial) not exactly syncronous in all districts; 
because the forms of organic life are probably not functions of the time but of the physical conditions, which no doubt vary with time"

"Lyell's assumption of a uniform rate of organic change was itself questionable, ... a fully ecological point of view would have to allow
for the possibility that fossils might charcterize particular environments far more than particular periods."
