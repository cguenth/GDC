Strata were originally formed from sediments that were deposited in flat horizontal sheets,
but in a number of places the strata are no longer horizontal but have been folded. 
The tops of large folds are commonly eroded away on Earth’s surface


[Formation of Strata - Folding]: Some strata are no longer horizontal but have been folded; 
the tops of large folds are commonly eroded away

[Formation of strata]: Strata are originally formed from sediments that were deposited in flat horizontal sheets -
the younger sediments deposited on older ones.

<Culm trough>: If strata are originally formed from sediments deposited in flat horizontal sheets
and there is a Culm trough in central Devon, 
then the Culm strata are younger than the strata in north and south Devon.

[North Devon and CAM]: In north Devon, there was some Cambrian strata (e.g. around Linton) #COA #chron-hyp

## ORS as a mere local variety

[ORS as a local variety]: The Old Red Sandstone was not longer regarded as the general type for its epoch, but as a local variety of the strata formed at that period #DEV #aux

[ORS Fauna peculiar]: Although very thick, the Old Red Sndstone had few fossils, and those few (mainly fossil fish) were very peculiar #DEV #ev

<ORS as Local Variety>: If there were true zoological transistions all the way from the lower Cambrian to the New Red Sandstone, but the Old Red Sndstone had few fossils, and those few (mainly fossil fish) were very peculiar, then the Old Red Sandstone strata were a mere local variety #DEV

## Siluria and zoological transitions

[Siluria and Zoological Transitions]: The Silurain region contained true zoological transistions all the way from the lower Cambrian to the New Red Sandstone - except for one missing transition between the Silurian and the Mountain Limestone #ev

<Zoological Transitions in Siluria>: If there had to be true zoological transitions from the Cambrian to the New Red Sandstone, then Silurain region contained such transistions #DEV
