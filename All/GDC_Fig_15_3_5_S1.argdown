[Standard Sequence]:  Given the strata are undisturbed, Cambrian strata are overlain by Silurian strata, Old Red Sandstone strata, Mountain Limestone strata, Coal Measures strata and New Red Sandstone strata, respectively #pri

[Formation of strata]: Strata are originally formed from sediments that were deposited in flat horizontal sheets - the younger sediments 
deposited on older ones. #pri

// [Definition Trough]: Iff strata are folded into an archlike form, with the concave side upward, then they form a trough #GRE #pri

# Evidence



[Unbroken Sequence of Devon Strata]: In Devon, *all* the strata - older than the New Red Sandstone - form an unbroken sequence of strata #ev #E1
 
[CM Plants in Devon Culm]: In Devon, the Culm strata contain Coal Measures fossil plants #ev #E2

[North of Exmoor]: Passing Exmoor northwards, the strata become older #ev #E3

[Trough through Exmoor]: There is a trough through Exmoor - formed by a band of limestone running out to the north coast at Ilfracombe 
and south of Barnstaple #ev #E4
 
[Instances of Coal in Ancient Strata]: In Munster and Pennsylvannia, there are coal deposits in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata #ev #E5

[CM Plants in Ancient Strata]: In pre-Old Red Sandstone strata, there are fossil plants similar to those of the Coal Measures  #GRE


<Culm and CM Plants>: If the Devon Culm strata are pre-Old Red Sandstone in age and there are no Coal Measures plants in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata,

[Flora Similarities as Best Explanation]: The best explanation of the existence of coal in some strata G is the similarity between G's flora 
and the one of the Coal Measures (the Coal Measures being noted for the great amounts of coal they contain) #GRE #aux


<Coal and CM Plants>: If the similarity between the floras of the Coal Measures and pre-Old Red Sandstone formations is the best explanation 
for the existence of coal deposists in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata, then there are Coal Measures plants in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata. #GRE

# Gap in the Sequence   {color: 4}


[Gap in a Sequence of Strata]: There is a gap in a local sequence of strata, iff there are strata juxtaposed belonging to different 
but not successive geological periods #pri

<Unbroken Sequence - GRE.1a>: If, in Devon, all the strata are Cambrian in age, i.e. belonging to the same geological period, then there is no gap in the 
local sequence. #GRE
