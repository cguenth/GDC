[Standard Sequence]:  Given the strata are undisturbed, Cambrian strata are overlain by Silurian strata, Old Red Sandstone strata, Mountain Limestone strata, Coal Measures strata and New Red Sandstone strata, respectively #pri

[Formation of strata]: Strata are originally formed from sediments that were deposited in flat horizontal sheets - the younger sediments 
deposited on older ones. #pri

// [Definition Trough]: Iff strata are folded into an archlike form, with the concave side upward, then they form a trough #GRE #pri

# Evidence



[Unbroken Sequence of Devon Strata]: In Devon, *all* the strata - older than the New Red Sandstone - form an unbroken sequence of strata #ev #E1
 
[CM Plants in Devon Culm]: In Devon, the Culm strata contain Coal Measures fossil plants #ev #E2

[North of Exmoor]: Passing Exmoor northwards, the strata become older #ev #E3

[Trough through Exmoor]: There is a trough through Exmoor - formed by a band of limestone running out to the north coast at Ilfracombe 
and south of Barnstaple #ev #E4
 
[Instances of Coal in Ancient Strata]: In Munster and Pennsylvannia, there are coal deposits in pre-Old Red Sandstone strata #ev #E5

E1 und E6 können beide zugleich falsch sein (Es gibt eine Lücke, aber nicht zwischen Culm und non-Culm)
E1 und E6 können nicht beide zugleich wahr sein: If all the strata form an unbroken sequence, then there is no gap in the sequence (E1 -> NOT:E5)
                                                  If there is a gap in the sequence, then the strata do not form an unbroken sequence (E5 -> NOT:E1)
[Gap in a Sequence of Strata]: There is a gap in a local sequence of strata, iff there are strata juxtaposed belonging to different but not successive geological periods #GRE #pri
[Gap in a Sequence of Strata II]: There is a gap in a local sequence of strata, iff certain formations are missing in that particular area from the standard sequence #GRE #pri
[Unconformity]: A lower set of strata is truncated at an angle and overlain by an upper set lying in a different orientation
                signalling that certain formations are missing in that particular area from the standard sequence
