[Culm as CM]: The Devonian Culm strata are Coal Measures in age #COA #H2

/* The explanations were understood to be rivals: */

[Culm as CM]
    -> [Devonian Strata as CAM] // H1 and H2 are contrary
    - [Devonian Strata as CAM]

# Arguments and Further Theses {isGroup: false}

/* The arguments reconstructed in this section detail whether the two hypotheses can explain or whether they conflict with the available evidence.
Arguments are tagged according to whether the lay out explanatory relations or conflicts of hypothesis GRE and COA. 
In addition to these arguments, the section makes further auxiliary assumptions explicit. */
